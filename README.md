# Cucumber JVM with Gradle and Geb Skeleton

##### This is to enable Geb Gradle using selenium ChromeDriver
##### This is a self exploratory example of automation framework build up on geb(selenium) & cucumber

## Prerequisite to run:
```bash
1.Java and Firefox installed on your system and system path.
2.Compatible chromedriver.exe(for windows) against installed Chrome browser version, in my case
      Chrome browser Version 51.0.2704.84
      chromedriver version 2.53.0
chromedriver please download from http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
3.Change credentials on login_steps.groovy >> test data to be relocated to login.groovy under src/test/resources/fixture
```

## This practice reflects good practice of below:
```bash
1.Web application automation framework on Gradle Cucumber Geb thru Groovy on Chrome & Firefox browsers
2.Data driven
3.Page Object Model
```

## From a command line run:
```
  ./gradlew cathyLinkedin
```
## From windows run:
```
   gradlew.bat cathyLinkedin
```
